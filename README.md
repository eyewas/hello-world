# hello-world
A repository I was instructed to create by the github tutorial.

Hello, my name is eye. I'm an enthusiastic programmer whos is learning the in's and out's of programming and always trying to get better at what I do. I am very new to github as of 10/26/19, but I aim to learn how to utilize this software to get better at programming in general, hopefully make some cool stuff, and have fun while working and interacting with other programmers like myself.
